## Using Ansible, OpenShift, and Servicenow to manage the complete lifecycle of VMs
Red Hat OpenShift Virtualiztion for enterprise workloads is a solution that WWT's clients are exploring.

As WWT clients evaluate running virtual machines with OpenShift Virtualization, the complete lifecycle of a machine or an application is in scope for an automated solution. As clients are exploring alternatives to their current virtualization provider, it is not only the virtual machines themselves, but the components in place to provision and maintain those virtual machines that go into the decision process. In this session we will demonstrate how Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization coupled with Ansible Automation Platform provides a seemless user experience for delivering solutions to business units.

The following technologies are in use for this solution demonstration:
- ServiceNow
- Ansible Automation Platform Controller
- Event-Driven Ansible
- OpenShift Virtualization

## Migrating virtual machines to OpenShift Virtualization with Ansible

Many of WWT's customers are exploring hypervisor alternatives. Among those choices is Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization. The OpenShift  Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) is a powerful tool for moving workloads quickly, while maintaining maximum uptime. Coupled with Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) customers can migrate virtual machines in bulk in a safe and repeatable way. WWT and Red Hat explore how organizations can use these technologies to optimize, simplify, and automate.

The solution uses Ansible to query for information in vSphere in order to build migration plans within OpenShift migration toolkit. This demonstration will allow us to migrate multiple virtual machines and ensure they are up and running in OpenShift. We can use dynamic documentation to show the state after the migration.

The following technologies are covered in this presentation:
- Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization
- Ansible Automation Platform
- VMware

## How does automation pay for itself?

Consumers of automation often feel the intrinsic value in their quality of life, quality of work, and efficiency. How do automation engineers convince the people in the corner office to invest? We take a look at some basic ways to measure automation and how to use those measurements to display a correlation between automation development and business value. We start with defining what is business value? We discuss ways to define metrics and to measure automation success including, but not limited to, Ansible Automation Analytics.
