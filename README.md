## Using Ansible, OpenShift, and Servicenow to manage the complete lifecycle of VMs
Red Hat OpenShift Virtualiztion for enterprise workloads is a solution that WWT's clients are exploring.

As WWT clients evaluate running virtual machines with OpenShift Virtualization, the complete lifecycle of a machine or an application is in scope for an automated solution. As clients are exploring alternatives to their current virtualization provider, it is not only the virtual machines themselves, but the components in place to provision and maintain those virtual machines that go into the decision process. In this session we will demonstrate how Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization coupled with Ansible Automation Platform provides a seemless user experience for delivering solutions to business units.

The following technologies are in use for this solution demonstration:
- ServiceNow
- Ansible Automation Platform Controller
- Event-Driven Ansible
- OpenShift Virtualization

## Migrating virtual machines to OpenShift Virtualization with Ansible

As organizations look to modernize their IT infrastructure, Red Hat OpenShift and Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) provide the perfect combination to simplify management, optimize resources, and automate complex workflows. Join Red Hat and World Wide Technology (WWT) for an in-depth session on the business value of adopting OpenShift Virtualization and AAP, and how leveraging these technologies together can transform your organization’s operations.

We’ll begin by exploring how Red Hat OpenShift virtualization enables organizations to consolidate their traditional and cloud-native applications onto a single platform, driving efficiency and reducing costs. Next, we’ll discuss how integrating Ansible Automation Platform can automate tasks across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, further streamlining operations and freeing up resources for innovation.


Automation Engineers, Virtualization Engineers, and all IT practicioners will benefit from the knowledge in this session. The solution uses Ansible to query for information in vSphere in order to build migration plans within OpenShift migration toolkit. This demonstration will allow us to migrate one or many  virtual machines and ensure they are up and running in OpenShift. The solutiona allows for follow on activity as well, such as using OpenShift networking, updating surrounding services, and creating dynamic documentation for the migrated infrastructure.

The following technologies are covered in this presentation:
- Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization
- Ansible Automation Platform
- VMware

## How does automation pay for itself?

Consumers of automation often feel the intrinsic value in their quality of life, quality of work, and efficiency. How do automation engineers convince the people in the corner office to invest? We take a look at some basic ways to measure automation and how to use those measurements to display a correlation between automation development and business value. We start with defining what is business value? We discuss ways to define metrics and to measure automation success including, but not limited to, Ansible Automation Analytics.

We will look at some basic measurement principles like engineer-hours saved and correlate that to money saved.
We will attempt to explain how to calculate a rate of return for investment in time and money to build an automated solution
Finally, we will quantify what less downtime could potentially mean to a businesses bottom line.
