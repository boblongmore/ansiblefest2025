## Using Ansible, OpenShift, and Servicenow to manage complete lifecycle of VMs
As consumers evaluate running virtual machines with OpenShift Virtualization, the complete lifecycle of a machine or an application is in scope for an automated solution. With a catalog item in Servicenow that sends a webhook to Event-Driven Ansible, the virtual machine is crated in openshift as well as monitoring configured for our Grafana Dashboard. Servicenow is then updated with CMDB information as well as closing the request.
