## Using Ansible, OpenShift, and Servicenow to manage complete lifecycle of VMs
Red Hat OpenShift Virtualiztion for enterprise workloads is a solution that WWT's clients are exploring.

As WWT clients evaluate running virtual machines with OpenShift Virtualization, the complete lifecycle of a machine or an application is in scope for an automated solution. In this session we will demonstrate how Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization coupled with Ansible Automation Platform provides a seemless user experience for delivering solutions to business units.

The following technologies are in use for this solution demonstration:
- ServiceNow
- Ansible Automation Platform Controller
- Event-Driven Ansible
- OpenShift Virtualization

WWT is a global services integrator and a Red Hat Premier Partner. Bob Longmore is a Technical Solutions Architect for WWT working with clients across many verticals such as Finance, Retail, Manafacturing, etc. and is a frequent presenter at Red Hat Summit, Meetups, and other industry events.


## Migrating virtual machines to OpenShift Virtualization with Ansible

Use Ansible to query for information in vSphere in order to build migration plans within OpenShift migration toolkit. This demonstration will allow us to migrate multiple virtual machines and ensure they are up and running in OpenShift. We can use dynamic documentation to show the state after the migration.
