## Using Ansible, OpenShift, and Servicenow to manage the complete lifecycle of VMs
Red Hat OpenShift Virtualiztion for enterprise workloads is a solution that WWT's clients are exploring.

As WWT clients evaluate running virtual machines with OpenShift Virtualization, the complete lifecycle of a machine or an application is in scope for an automated solution. As clients are exploring alternatives to their current virtualization provider, it is not only the virtual machines themselves, but the components in place to provision and maintain those virtual machines that go into the decision process. In this session we will demonstrate how Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization coupled with Ansible Automation Platform provides a seemless user experience for delivering solutions to business units.

The following technologies are in use for this solution demonstration:
- ServiceNow
- Ansible Automation Platform Controller
- Event-Driven Ansible
- OpenShift Virtualization

## Migrating virtual machines to OpenShift Virtualization with Ansible

Use Ansible to query for information in vSphere in order to build migration plans within OpenShift migration toolkit. This demonstration will allow us to migrate multiple virtual machines and ensure they are up and running in OpenShift. We can use dynamic documentation to show the state after the migration.

The following technologies are covered in this presentation:
- Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization
- Ansible Automation Platform
- VMware
